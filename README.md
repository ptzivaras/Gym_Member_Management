This is a Gym Admin Applicatiin, you can add new customers to them gym, edit their profiles while adding a membership which they payed. So 3 tables payments membership and customers. Lastly we add trainers and their classes. You can view the classes day/time in the gym, the customerrs ,a dashboard.
I have experienced various problems and business logic mistakes. This has not been finished. This project is purely for training.
I have used css,scss,html,js,React, ReduxToolkit(need refactor and break into components to actually make sense), maybe normalization in DB(for training), React Table Library, Java, Spring, Postgre.
